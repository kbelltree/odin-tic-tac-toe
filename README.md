## Summary 
In this project, I used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to construct a desktop-browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The goal was to demonstrate what I had previously learned of JavaScript Factory Function, IIFE Module, Scope, and Closure. Details on the project are available [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).

**Project Instructions**:
1. Initiate a game board using an array.
2. Store players within objects.
3. Use modules/factory functions for code encapsulation.
4. Integrate code logically.
5. Render X and O from game board to HTML.
6. Include a function to determine game status (winner or tie).
7. Implement start/reset button, player name input, and winner notification spot.

    **Optional (Not implemented)**: Create an AI for random moves, and then make it unbeatable.  

I've employed a combination of newly acquired and foundational skills throughout this project. Here's a breakdown:
